## Board of Trustees

governs the college by establishing broad policies and objectives. Cooper’s board is composed of about twenty unpaid members that meet about four times a year. The board appoints the President.

## Administrators

are college employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution separate from the faculty. Administrative responsibilities include academic affairs, school finances, fundraising, public affairs, and press.
Administrative bloat is a term used for the inflated administrative ratios in recent years. Between 1993 and 2007, spending on administration rose twice as fast as funding for research and teaching at 198 leading U.S. universities. 

At a time where college budgets are tight, students are amassing record debt, and tuition is skyrocketing, the ratio of administrators to faculty has jumped up  in the past decade: across universities nationwide employment of administrators has risen 60 percent from 1993 to 2009, 10 times the growth rate for tenured faculty.  

## Tenured professors

refers to a senior professor’s contractual right not to have their position terminated without just cause. In 1975, 57% of all college professors had tenure or were on a tenure track, in 2007, that number had fallen to 31%.

## Adjunct professors

are part-time, non-salaried, non-tenure track faculty members who are paid for each class they teach. Adjuncts have no office or materials or supplies, limited technology and administrative support, are not paid for office hours, and have no job security since they are often hired per class. Studies have also shown that sustained interaction with faculty members beyond the classroom directly correlates with measures of student success such as retention and progress toward degree. 

## Unions 

are an organization of workers that have banded together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of their trade, achieving higher pay, increasing the number of employees and employer hires, and bettering working conditions. Unions in general are in decline in the United States, academic unions in particular are under attack, and a large majority of faculty members hold part-time, nontenurable jobs that benefit from collective bargaining power.

Some campuses have made it difficult for faculty and staff to organize and have a voice as decisions have become more centralized within institutions.
