## **Q:** Whats next??

**A:** Whatever the fuck you want, get at us—we got you.

## **Q:** What does the larger class size mean for Cooper?

**A:** Engineering is the only larger incoming class: 150 (20 more than normal), they did it to fix lower application rate. The administration's platform is growth and ours is not growth. Cooper will only keep expanding, new masters programs coming soon. Faculty are on our side, having worked on an initiative called "living within our means and mission." What the admin is doing with launching all these programs is a classic bureaucratic technique called stake-driving.

## **Q:** How will the PILOT impact Cooper?

**A:** PILOT stands for Payment In Lieu Of Taxes. It means that, because Cooper owns the land beneath the Chrysler Building, all of its tenants' taxes go to support Cooper. (This is a sum of 10s of million of dollars per year, which jumps up every decade.) It's a rare and historical tax exemption granted by the city to Peter Cooper because the college was founded for the benefit of New York's working class. Tuition damages the argument that Cooper is still providing the city with such a benefit, therefore jeopardizing the continued existence of the PILOT agreement. The Board went through several sets of lawyers until they found one who would tell them what they wanted to hear: that charging tuition wouldn't jeopardize the PILOT, so now they flaunt this myth.

## **Q:** Doesn’t the value of real estate flux?

**A:** Yes, in different ways. The Chrysler/PILOT will jump up in 2018. The Board authorized themselves to take out a "bridge loan" of about $50 million to cover costs until then, including the ramp up in infrastructure costs for charging tuition (e.g. enrollment services consultants). A Board myth related to this is that because inflation (the rate at which most costs rise) is a percentage-increase, and the Chrysler/PILOT is a step function (increasing once every 10 years), the PILOT won't increase fast enough to cover Cooper's costs. However, this is assuming the Board's platform that the right strategy for Cooper is to keep expanding. If we were to cut costs significantly, and reorganize the college according to faculty's ideas about creating a free school within our means, perhaps we'd have a surplus.

## **Q:** What happens if we lose the CSCU trial?

**A:** Looking back, you could also have asked: What happens if the Working Group is rejected? What happens if tuition is charged? What happens if the Task Forces flop? The simple answer is: don’t hold your breath for any one initiative, and don't operate on anyone else's timeline. Be informed, prepared, and remember: now is always the time for principled action.

## **Q:** Is there a reason the school hasn’t sent bills yet?

**A:** Apparently, they will be mailed September 15th. Maybe it's an opportunity to burn them publicly.

## **Q:** Can you explain the lawsuit

**A:** Faculty, students, and alumni are suing the board. You can learn everything you ever wanted to know and more at http://savecooperunion.org. While Free Cooper focuses largely on the future and the present, the lawsuit focuses on the past: referring mostly to the college's founding documents.

## **Q:** How can we survive without the PILOT?

**A:** The board is taking a gamble and largely refuses to address this beyond citing that random lawyer. They're scared but not showing it.

## **Q:** Heard that Jamshed’s contract is up in two years but the Board might be lazy and keep him on? Can we take it into our own hands?

**A:** Absolutely. The Board wants to claim that nobody wants Bharucha's job, but the rest of the community is desperate for a say in Cooper's governance. We've got a lot of starting points on alternative methods of governance that we should all flesh out together. Let's start a reading, research and writing group. Things to talk about and look into: sunset clause, Antioch, melting Jamshed’s brain, horizontality, open source, leadership teams, and The Associates. Another note: Jamshed is basically irrelevant and hiding. He's trying to lay low. Do with that what you will.

## **Q:** Can the admin take away our financial aid if we protest?

**A:** You should still have protection under FAFSA. Remember that there's safety in numbers. Collective your risk. Other schools charge and do direct actions, so there's precedent. Know that the community, the faculties, (and Canada) are behind you, and Student Judicial Committee will go to bat for you.

## **Q:** If the Code of Conduct was a preventative action about student rights and discipline, are there similarly preventative actions we can take about the finances and transparency?

**A:** The Board still refuses to allow the community granular enough access to Cooper's finances to plan a different option. The Working Group negotiated access, put a plan together, and the Board rejected it — not because it wasn't financially viable, but because it didn't align with their philosophy. The CSCU lawsuit is asking for open books, but whistleblowing and leaking needlessly confidential information are two preventative tactics in this regard.

## **Q:** You didn't answer my question!

**A:** Reply to this email and we'll see what we can do.
