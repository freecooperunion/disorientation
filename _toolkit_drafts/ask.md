## Q: Why is the Attorney General Investigating Cooper Union?

**A:** The investigation is focusing on the board’s management of its endowment; its handling of its major asset, the Chrysler Building; its dealings with Tishman Speyer Properties, which manages the skyscraper; and how it obtained a $175 million loan from MetLife using the building as collateral, according to people involved.

## Q: Why is Jamshed Bharucha not returning?

**A:** The official Board of Trustee narrative claims that they “offered to not renew the contract of Jamshed Bharucha” in a deal to end the Attorney General’s investigation. But in the same expository article by the WSJ, AG Eric Schneiderman claimed this would not affect his office’s investigation whatsoever. Jamshed himself was interviewed in the expository article, leading many to believe that he himself leaked the decision in a move observed simply as petulant sabotage. We don’t put it past him.

## Q: Why have students been accepted for an imaginary CS program? 

**A:** The administration has admitted 31 students to attend a CS program in the fall that currently has no dedicated faculty members, no classrooms, and a plagiarized curriculum. This program has not been approved by the Engineering faculty.

## Q: Why has the administration repeatedly turned down offers from alumni and faculty to offset tuition, such as a trustee’s own multi-million dollar offer?

**A:** Despite ongoing community efforts, the administration and board have intentionally tried to make the community out as being uninvolved and unwilling to donate. As a result, a parallel campaign has formed, including a supreme court lawsuit. The administration had invested so deeply in the infrastructure to charge tuition that they were unwilling to consider alternatives, despite a viable community generated plan.

## Q: Why do we have four vice presidents and 24 directors for a school of 1000 students?

**A:** More and more administrators are being hired and promoted, while faculty salaries and hires remain frozen, and staff and technicians are being cut. Instead of considering what Cooper needs, the administration is imitating other institutions’ meaningless “benchmarks” and “best practices”.

## Q: Why did the board approve a $175 million loan to construct an extravagant new academic building without finding an appropriate donor or source of funding?

**A:** The board’s hubris surrounding this decision was based on their perceived business acumen, despite votes of no confidence from the engineering faculty whom the construction would impact the most. Further, a non-alum was chosen to design the new building of a school with a world-class architecture program despite outrage from the Architecture School.

## Q: Why can so many of Cooper’s business dealings be traced back to the families and companies of Board members?

**A:** This is one of the reason the Attorney General is getting involved. Many conflicts of interest and appearances of self-dealing have been revealed by the lawsuit.  The administration continues to consolidate power among upper administration. Many key employees have been fired or forced out, while most new hires and promotions don’t follow HR protocol. Jamshed Bharucha is the first president to sit on the board as a member.

## Q: Why has the board spent million of dollars on outside consultants?

**A:** Consultants and lawyers are hired at exorbitant rates ostensibly to advise the board on matters of corporate structure, public relations, crisis management, and enrollment services — ultimately to tell the administration what they want to hear. The administration and board regularly hire and fire these groups.

## Q: Why is there so much frivolous spending?

**A:** The administration insists it should be matching the spending of other colleges in order to stay competitive, despite spending metrics being arbitrary and often linked to institutions that have historically been structured drastically differently than Cooper. They constitute what we consider frivolous as being "competitive" because they've accepted that it is going to cost the college a significant amount to recover from charging tuition.

## Q: Why is the administration trying to shrink the art school out of existence while rapidly expanding the engineering school?

**A:** In addition to not replacing art professors that have retired with full-time faculty while admitting students to an imaginary CS program, the administration has repeatedly undervalued the contributions of the art school and alumni, because their relationship to career tracks and income are not as direct as engineering or architecture. They want to transform the art school into a design institute because they believe its a more easily marketable skill.

## Q: Why won’t they show us Cooper’s finances?

**A:** The trustees have instituted a strict non-disclosure policy in order to justify their closed-circuit decision-making. The administration and board insist that the community doesn’t understand the gravity of Cooper’s financial situation, while simultaneously denying the community access to the granular level of information required for agency and credible decision-making. These compounding factors prevent the generation of alternative plans to tuition.
