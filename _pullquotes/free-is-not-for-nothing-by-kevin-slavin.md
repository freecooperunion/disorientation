Tomorrow, January 10th, the Trustees for Cooper Union (myself included) will vote on whether to keep the school lean and free, or to introduce tuition, after 150 years without it.

If the vote goes one way, a new, lean, careful Cooper Union will tiptoe forward, tuition-free. It will require equal parts deep sacrifice, wild ambition, and straightforward pragmatism. And it will uphold a 150+ year tradition of free undergraduate education.

If it goes the other way, all of that will disappear. Not just the free tuition, but everything that was built on it. In its place we’ll find a tragic fraud. A joke. A zombie.

Toward the end of those 150 years, a series of factors conspired to bring it to a close: unsupervised, poor, and negligent financial decisions, a profoundly irresponsible and unapologetic President or two, opaque and unaccountable decision-making, and several years of paltering and deceptive communications, to the press and to the community.

In 2013, faced with a “suddenly-revealed” existential crisis of staggering deficits, the Board of Trustees (with a new President they brought in) voted to put tuition in place.

The board explained that tuition is necessary to forestall closure, even though a tuition plan still requires a $50MM bridge loan. They explained that it maintains the principles of the school, because it’s still, you know, cheaper than really expensive schools.

They will tell you that it’s tuition, yes, but half-price, $20,000. They will tell you that students without privilege will still get the aid they need.

In response to (and in negotiation with) the longest student occupation in the history of the United States, a Working Group was formed to find a plan to keep it free. It was composed of Trustees, alumni, staff and students. The Working Group did the long overdue work of finding every means necessary to keep the school free. This is, in principle, the President’s job. Whatever.

Not everyone supports the plan. The President doesn’t support the plan. A dean he hired (a professor who just arrived from North Carolina with clear opinions out of the gate) doesn’t support it, and nor does the President’s chief of staff. Also, the President of Vassar doesn’t support it (she sits on the Board of Trustees.)

But many of us support the Working Group Plan, as alumni, Trustees, students, faculty. We support it reluctantly, because it’s not great news. But it’s the best news possible.

It would certainly be easier to accept tuition. But we support this more difficult option because we understand the value of free. And unlike most of those who doubt its value: we lived it. Unlike the President, unlike his Chief of Staff, unlike the President of Vassar, unlike most everyone who opposes the plan to keep it free, we experienced a free school firsthand, and we know what it means, to us and to the world.

If you’ve never experienced it, “free” just seems like a lower number on a slider that has “half-price” in the middle. But free is not a number.

Free for everyone meant that the students who were there were beholden to nothing (nothing!) except their passion, talent, hard work, and brilliance. This unique, very particular sensibility — that, more than any other thing they could build, hire or install — this was the experience of the institution.

Academic quality is a framing, a mindset, for the best students andfor the best faculty, all of whom have choices about where to settle down. They won’t come to Cooper because it’s cheaper. They went there because it was free. We were seeking an exceptional environment. Genuinely exceptional. Cooper Union was exceptional.

It came to the edge through mismanagement and misconduct. And now, I fear, misunderstanding. Most anyone who experienced it knows that the tuition-free education was the source of academic excellence, not the threat to it.
