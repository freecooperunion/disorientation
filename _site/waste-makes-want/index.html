		<h1>Waste Makes Want</h1>
		<h2></h2>
	</header>
	<p>In a sworn Cy Pres Petition statement to the NYS Supreme Court in 2006, the Cooper Union Board of Trustees petitioned for the right to borrow $175 million against the Chrysler building.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Cy Pres they committed to reducing operating expenditures by 10% by 2011.</li>

<li>Instead, expenses steadily rose from $43.7 million in 2006 to $66.8 million in 2010 (excluding debt service &amp; depreciation the rise was from $39.4m to $49.8m).</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the message broadcast by Cooper Union in Wall St. Journal and New York Times articles was that they had attained financial stability, pointing to a huge but misleading increase in the endowment as a result of the way the Chrysler building was handled on the books.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2006 CU Development spent $2.2 million to raise $18.7 million ($0.12 per $1 raised).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In 2012 CU Development spent $3.9 million to raise $7.5 million ($0.52 per $1 raised).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>According to the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (C.A.S.E.), it should cost about $0.17 to raise a dollar.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In 1998 the CU President’s compensation was $205,047 / yr, now it is $647,330/ yr.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In 2009 the President’s salary was in the top 10 nationally (relative to school budget).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>From 2005 to 2010, CU full-time faculty wages stayed roughly the same at about $5m.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>From 2005 to 2010, CU non-faculty salaries and wages went from about $12.5m to $17.5m.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cost of benefits went from $2.5m in 2002 to $10m in 2012, an unsustainable trajectory.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Defined benefit plans such as CU’s have been converted out by many other companies (people are living longer &amp; medical expenses higher than when plans started back in the 60s).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The recent decision to institute tuition not only runs counter to the 150 year mission of the school, but also potentially jeopardizes the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) payments Cooper Union has been receiving from the City of New York.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that once schools start charging tuition, the tuition keeps increasing, regardless of the financial aid provided. The current administration has not emphasized support for the free tuition mission and instead has pushed to build a “global brand” to realize the “enormous untapped potential” of Cooper Union.</p>

<p>From the above it seems clear that the Cooper Union Administration and Trustees have a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the Cooper community. They need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Seriously scale back spending (oddly the Expense Reduction Task force limited the reduction target to 12% and declared off bounds some of the most important areas for expense reduction, including administrative headcount and benefits).</li>

<li>Seriously engage with important constituencies including unions to address key issues such as Cooper’s unsustainable and antiquated defined benefit plan.</li>

<li>Fundraise to preserve free tuition (a capital campaign to help preserve free tuition should actually have been done before the historic mission of free tuition was announced as suspended).</li>
</ol>

<p>Until the Cooper Union administration gets its house in order it seems unlikely that major donors (or any donors) will feel comfortable giving to their full potential.</p>
