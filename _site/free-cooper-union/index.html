<p>In December of 2012, eleven students occupied the Foundation Building’s clock tower for one week in order to combat the administration’s claim that adopting tuition would be the college’s only sustainable financial model. During the lock-in, students began organizing as Students For A Free Cooper Union and issued these demands and principles (opposite page). Building off of the 2012 Quebec student movement against tuition hikes, symbolized by the carré rouge (red square), student occupiers at Cooper illuminated the clock tower with red lights. The red clock has since been a symbol of Free Cooper Union supporters.</p>

<h3 id='demands'>Demands</h3>

<ol>
<li>The administration must publicly affirm the college’s commitment to free education. They will stop pursuing new tuition-based educational programs and eliminate other ways in which students are charged for education.</li>

<li>The Board of Trustees must immediately implement structural changes with the goal of creating open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. The administration’s gross mismanagement of the school cannot be reversed within the same systems which allowed the crisis to occur. To this end, we have outlined actions that the board must take:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Record board meetings and make minutes publicly available.</li>

<li>Appoint a student and faculty member from each school as voting members of the board.</li>

<li>Implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote from the Cooper Union community, comprised of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>President Bharucha steps down.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='principles'>Principles</h3>

<h4 id='higher_education_bubble'>Higher Education Bubble</h4>

<p>The over-inflated costs of higher education have placed more than a trillion dollars of debt onto the backs of students. Higher education should be a means of social mobility and intellectual liberation, but it has devolved into an industry that exploits students for profit. Inevitably this bubble will burst and what appears to be a healthy and growing educational system will be revealed as a model that was always doomed to fail.</p>

<h4 id='grow_down'>Grow Down</h4>

<p>The administrators who have grown us into this mess are trying to grow us out of it. Investing in the higher education bubble is short-sighted and uncreative. Playing a larger role in one’s community provides strong roots. If we refuse to invest in a growth model and reaffirm our mission, we stand to see the principles of free education bring life back to our own community and other institutions as well.</p>

<h4 id='structures_for_transparency_and_integrity'>Structures for Transparency and Integrity</h4>

<p>Bloated and visionless administrations have become an epidemic threatening institutions of higher education all across America. We must rebuild the governance of these institutions with open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. Carrying a mission such as free education will require principled, rather than self-sustaining, leadership.</p>
