<p>President Richard Humphreys expressed concern about the finances of the school, recommended against developing graduate programs and new buildings.</p>

<h2 id='19691979'>1969-1979</h2>

<p>Under President John White, Cooper Union revised its charter to no longer make trustees personally liable for the college’s debts, and to allow the college to take out large building loans.</p>

<p>The first loan from DASNY (Dormitory Authority of the State of New York) financed a renovation of the Foundation Building by John Hejduk plunging the college into deficit, forcing the sale of Green Camp, and the elimination of the physics and night degree programs.</p>

<h2 id='19801987'>1980-1987</h2>

<p>Under President Bill Lacy the faculty union that formed after the elimination of the physics degree was threatened with elimination, the case lost in court.</p>

<h2 id='19882000'>1988-2000</h2>

<p>President John Iselin oversaw the construction of a dormitory for out-of-state students using a second DASNY loan that again plunged the college into deficit.</p>

<h2 id='20012011'>2001-2011</h2>

<p>President George Campbell established tuition at The Cooper Union in order to become eligible for Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) funds for needy students.</p>

<p>An ULURP (Uniform Land Use Review Procedure) process, allowing Cooper to lease out some properties for luxury and commercial development during the development of the New Academic Building (NAB) was approved.</p>

<p>New York State Supreme Court allowed Cooper to increase its debt significantly by mortgaging the Chrysler Building. Cooper Union got the loan, paid off the DASNY bonds, guaranteed a maximum price for construction of the NAB, and invested heavily in hedge funds.</p>

<p>In 2006, the Board renegotiated the 150 year Chrysler Building lease with Tishman (started in 1999) so that payments would platueau incrementally, the first bump is scheduled for 2018.</p>

<p>The crash of 2008 resulted in huge losses in the investment portfolio, delays in construction at 51 Astor, and a sudden drop-off in charitable contributions. Press and trustees were told that Cooper had survived the crash and was “in the black,” expenditures continued to rise resulting in the largest deficits the Cooper Union had ever known.</p>

<h2 id='2011'>2011-</h2>

<p>Jamshed Bharucha was elected by the board of trustees to “reinvent” the college.</p>

<p>With five years until the bump the college is cash-poor in unrestricted endowment funds, despite previous claims of financial stability.</p>
