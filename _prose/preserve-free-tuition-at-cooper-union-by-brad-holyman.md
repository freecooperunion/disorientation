Charging tuition at The Cooper Union—a beacon of educational equality in Manhattan’s rapidly changing East Village, which I represent in the state Senate—is a betrayal of New York’s trust that not only jeopardizes the college’s reputation, but also its standing in our community. Unless a lawsuit brought by a coalition of students, alumni and faculty succeeds in preserving Peter Cooper’s mission of free tuition at this historic school—or the Attorney General intervenes—tuition bills will start arriving next month in the mailboxes of incoming students for the first time in the school’s 155-year history.

When the state enacted legislation codifying Peter Cooper’s vision of free tuition a century and a half ago, it established the basis for decades of public support and financing. For example, Cooper Union does not pay property taxes on the Chrysler Building, even though it is not used for academic purposes—a tax subsidy worth $19 million annually. The school has had to defend its unique tax subsidy repeatedly throughout its history and has done so by citing its tuition-free status, which, as they have argued in court, essentially makes it an extension of the city's public education system. 

If Cooper Union becomes a tuition-based college, it will no longer be a unique extension of our state’s public education system, raising the question of whether it is still deserving of taxpayer support. In the long run, the cost of charging tuition may in fact be higher than the benefit.

It’s especially troubling that Cooper Union hasn’t publicly made an adequate case for its departure from the school’s traditional operating model. One of the answers being sought by the coalition of students, faculty and alumni is an accounting of the “fiscal crisis” that supposedly led the administration to start charging tuition in the first place. They deserve a thorough and transparent explanation from the college, detailing exactly how the administration managed the school’s finances and arrived at the decision to charge tuition, despite the fact that the rent Cooper Union receives from the Chrysler building will soar from about $9 million this year to $32.5 million in 2018.

It’s time for the board, state and local government officials, and all parties involved, to forge a plan that will preserve Peter Cooper’s model of free tuition and save this great institution from becoming just another college.
