Because they’re current, not incoming, students, none of the people occupying that office will have to pay tuition. They don't care. Saar Shemesh, an art student, said, "We've been granted this amazing education for free. Future students don't have a voice yet. If we don't fight for them, no one will."

Outside, perhaps 50 protesters hold a solidarity rally. Occupiers bang pans next to veterans of the CUNY student protests, all while being filmed by the inevitable live-streamer. Many wear the red square of Quebec's student strikes—the carre rouge that has become an international symbol of debt. Bored cops wait, their waists loaded with zipcuffs. An old man plays the sax.  

The crowd chanted "No debt! No fees! Cooper Union will be free!"

"This is a much bigger fight than against our administration," Angus said. "In America, the rich can get an education. The poor have to take out loans, and are burdened by debt from the day they graduate."

There's an American tendency to accuse those who want social services of entitlement. Who are you, the thinking goes, to demand college? To demand food? To think that you should work fewer than 12 hours a day, or not die of untreated illness, or have a dignified old age? The Cooper Union students are getting their share of that. But they make a particularly poor target. They are largely bright working class kids who passed brutal admissions to attend a school whose reason for existing is to educate them for free.

"This isn't just about Cooper Union," said Saar Shemash. "The problem of tuition hikes is something that afflicts every university. We're not isolated. Our occupation is not something that should go on for a few days for people to eventually forget about. It is something that should happen on campuses around the country, around the world."
