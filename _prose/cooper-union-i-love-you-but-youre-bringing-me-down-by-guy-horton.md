Cooper Union received its death sentence once it moved away from the founder’s premise and started getting creative with its finances. It became obsessed with the machinations of Wall Street. In the 1970s it started selling off the properties that once kept it afloat and tuition free, short-term cash infusions that have ultimately turned out to be like getting tainted blood.

To attract and retain strong presidents it takes extremely high salaries. In the last year of his presidency, George Campbell was paid $668,473. After he left the post in 2011 he was paid $1,307,483. Nice little parachute.

In just two years there have been 13 board resignations. Seems “The 13” didn’t want their reputations tarnished by being at the helm when the ship went down. Or they resigned in protest.

Such governance instability is not the death sentence. Having a heavily finance- and investment-driven board was the death sentence. But isn’t this is the normal demographic of boards wherever they are and whatever institution they are guiding? The team was following the logic of a brand of capitalism that Peter Cooper would not have understood, though he may have inadvertently helped to create it. This is capitalism that doesn’t produce things. It liquidates, reallocates, diversifies, re-balances, corrects.
