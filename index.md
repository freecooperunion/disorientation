intro: "**Disorientation** is a counter-orientation intended to introduce the incoming class to the real story of Cooper’s dense internal politics, as well as larger student issues. This is an effort to preserve institutional memory that is all too often expunged upon graduation."

**A note on abridgement.**  
Much of the content in this reader has been hacked and slashed edited to fit within these pages. You can access unabridged versions of the works — and other content like videos and an interactive timeline — online.
