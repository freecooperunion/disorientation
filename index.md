We're [a group of art students](/people). (You can [join too](mailto:cuartcouncil@gmail.com?subject=Joining%20Art%20Student%20Council).) We get to go to faculty and administrative meetings within the existing bureaucratic structure at Cooper. We get to vote on behalf of students and [take **notes** which we share](/notes). The school gives us money to throw parties. We're whatever the student body needs their bureaucratic presence to be.

Peruse the [about section](/about) to learn more about our [structure](/about/committees), [technology](/about/this-site), and commitment to [transparency](/about/transparency).
