**A note on abridgement.**  
Much of the content in this reader has been <strike>hacked and slashed</strike> edited to fit within these pages. You can access unabridged versions of the works — and other content like videos and an interactive timeline — at our website.

**Correct us if we’re wrong.**  
We’ve been compiling information for three years, but we’re still learning. We did our best to fact-check before printing, but we’ll do our best to amend inaccuracies.

**There are no stupid questions.**
