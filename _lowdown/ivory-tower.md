In Summer 2013, the students occupying President Bharucha's office were approached by a team of documentary filmmakers led by Andrew Rossi (director of Page One: Inside the New York Times) about participating in their upcoming project “Ivory Tower,” an exposé on higher education across the country. The filmmakers followed the campaign through the entire summer and into the fall, documenting meetings, actions, and ongoing student organizing.

Ivory Tower premiered in Spring 2014 at Sundance Film Festival, contextualizing the struggle for free education at Cooper alongside Harvard, California’s UC system, historically black Spelman College, Massive Open Online Courses, Deep Springs, and many more. Taking the time to speak to faculty and students, Ivory Tower did justice to the community’s principled rage. The film opened in theaters around the country in Summer 2014, and in Fall 2014 will be airing on CNN as well as touring college campuses.
