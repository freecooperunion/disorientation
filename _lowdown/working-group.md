The occupation of President Bharucha’s office lasted 65 days (among the longest student occupations in US history) ending in a negotiation between students and trustees, led by Jeff Gural and Mike Borokowsky. The occupation may have carried on, had the students not been informed by trustees that the administration was finalizing a plan to have NYPD clear out the occupation by arresting all involved. 

The terms of the negotiated agreement included the creation of a “Working Group” made up of students, alumni, faculty, staff, and administrators with the sole purpose of researching a financial model that could disprove the Board’s decision to charge tuition. Crucially, this was the first time that many of these parties (aside from the administration) would supposedly be granted access to any of Cooper’s confidential financial documents deemed necessary. The negotiation also included amnesty from disciplinary action for those involved in the occupation, as well as the creation of a “Community Commons” space (on which the board later reneged entirely), and the appointment of a student representative to the Board (which happened despite attempts by the Board to renege).

The administration delayed the Working Group’s start for a month by deciding not to appoint their members in a timely fashion, as well as suddenly firing an administrator key to financial operations and faculty negotiations necessary for the group to convene. The community also took issue with the fact that the administration appointed their members, while every other constituency held direct elections. The firing meant that financial documents had to be requested through interim consultants, which proved to be another form of obstruction.

Despite compounding setbacks, at the end of eight weeks, the Working Group had successfully <a href="http://cooper.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/assets/site/files/2013/WrkingGrpRpt_1212.pdf">produced a report</a> to be presented to the Board at their December meeting. These efforts were undermined the night before the Board meeting with the release of a “Minority Report” authored in secret by the administration’s Working Group representatives. Instead of bringing their issues to the Working Group for discussion and resolution before the presentation, these administrators took it upon themselves to remain silent and then publish a line-by-line refutation of the group’s model.

The Working Group issued a stipulation that their model was only to be considered in full, and not to be deployed in conjunction with tuition as an a la carte menu of cost reductions.

The Board voted against the plan, though the breakdown was never disclosed. Against the stipulation, the Board is beginning to charge tuition as well as leveraging the austerity measures put forward in good faith by the Working Group.
