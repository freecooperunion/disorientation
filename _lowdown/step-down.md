Is Bharucha still ‘salvageable’ as President? Could he conceivably change his course to save Cooper Union with its mission of “Free Education to All”? It’s worth looking back at Bharucha’s track record to assess whether or not he is fit to lead.

## Bharucha has never supported the mission.

He refuses to recognize the value of tuition-free education or its role in the history of Cooper Union. He has never stated that returning to a tuition-free institution is a goal or priority. On the eve of his inauguration, he ordered the mission statement be changed on cooper.edu, to omit the section about merit-based full-tuition scholarships being granted to all admitted students.

## Bharucha has not delivered on repeated promises about transparency in decision-making

On September 21st, 2012 the Office of the President introduced “Board Reports” to “provide information about decisions and other outcomes that result from the quarterly Board of Trustees meetings.” Only one board report has ever been published.

## Bharucha has not acknowledged the Board’s financial negligence.

Despite numerous articles published on Cooper’s financial decisions in light of the Vote of No Confidence, there has been no communication from the Board of Trustees to claim responsibility for their negligence. Bharucha has blamed the alumni, students, faculty and community and approved of passing debt onto future students.

## Bharucha cherry-picks from history to support his agenda.

In 1902 after Andrew Carnegie gave his large donation to Cooper, it was decided that all admitted students would receive full tuition scholarships because of the “insidious divide” between the paying and non-paying students. 
Bharucha has marginalized and disregarded the voices and alternative models of the student, faculty, staff, and alumni community over the last two years.

### 1. The Way Forward

The Way Forward is a document put together by alumni, students, professors and faculty that go by Friends of Cooper Union (FOCU). It was a first attempt by community members to put forward an alternative to the tuition-based models that Bharucha has been promoting since October 2011. FOCU did the best they could with virtually no acces to Cooper’s official finances. Instead of welcoming the effort and trying to galvanize the community, Bharuch deemed it a “laughing stock”, his response lacks the same good-faith effort put into writing the document. The Way Forward hold true to the mission, Peter Cooper’s ideals and the spirit, creativity and resilience of the community.

### 2. Within Our Mission, Within Our Means

Art faculty “within our mission, within our means” discussions with the Faculty of the Whole (all 4 schools) were cut short by threats to shut down the School of Art. As retribution for going against the administration, Bharucha and the board moved to deferral of early decision School of Art applicants midway the admissions cycle.

### 3. Faculty ‘coercion’

In 2011, the deans of the three degree-granting schools were charged with coming up with revenue generating academic programs as a part of President Bharucha’s “reinvention.”

The faculty were forced to design revenue generating programs. The Art faculty, refusing to endorse their plans issued a statment in support of the mission. Despite open access to their plans, Bharucha refused to pass them onto the Board until the Art faculty publicly endorsed them. Bharucha often says that he won’t  to do anything “without the support of his faculty”, it is clear he is willing to secure “support” by any means necessary.
      
With more than 2,500 votes of “no confidence” in Bharucha, including votes passed by the School of Art, and School of Art Full-Time faculty, as well as a majority of the Faculty of the Humanities vote of no confidence in “the leadership” of the institution, what is lacking is an earnest engagement with the community in generating solutions which uphold the mission of free education to all.

## Bharucha maintains an oppressive and policing environment.

Increased private security measures to keep alumni out and to monitor students, faculty and their gatherings. 

Multiple instances of armed guards in the building without informing deans, students, parents, and faculty.

Confiscation and/or dismantling of approved artwork from classrooms, hallways and exhibition spaces.

Adjunct faculty (who make up the majority of faculty) having had their jobs threatened if they sign the vote of no confidence.

Student arrested while trying to leave Foundation Building during a protest she was not involved in (Sarah Abruna, 2011).

Bharucha has failed to articulate a vision for the future of Cooper.

On May 11, 2013 Bharucha reiterated his five-point vision of the school: 

> “a student body that thrives on an intimate, immersive, rigorous conservatory-style education; a unique set of schools; a commitment to access for those who can least afford it; the historic Great Hall; and the most vibrant location on earth.”

 This is merely a description, not a vision. 

## Bharucha can’t explain free education to donors.

Bharucha doesn’t know what goes on in our classes or how our education happens. Why is he the one talking to Bloomberg and other potential large donors? How can we expect him to sell the school to donors if he can’t even talk about the school passionately. 

President Bharucha doesn’t believe that Cooper’s full-tuition scholarship is necessary, he believes it to be resource that’s run dry. How can Bharucha sell the egalitarian vision of ‘free education for all’ to donors if he doesn’t even believe in it. Trustee Mike Borkowsky has very elegantly described his feelings about Cooper:

> “I got a degree in mechanical engineering from Cooper and never spent a moment of my working life as a mechanical engineer or as any other kind of engineer. Given that fact, many people wonder why I have spent so much of my life involved with the school. It is because Cooper Union embodies, in my mind, the ideal of higher education. You put 1,000 of the brightest, most creative young people together, with no regard for their economic status or personal backgrounds, challenge them to work as hard as they can, to collaborate rather than compete with each other, give them the opportunity to interact fully with faculty, set them all in the dynamic environment of New York City and do it with no charge for tuition and you have an institution of learning that is unique in all the world and must be saved.”

## Bharucha has diffused accountability and blame

Bharucha’s administration is heavily stacked and growing. He is the singular bottleneck between the Cooper community and the Board, he has withheld information from both parties and continually misrepresents the Cooper community by casting it in a bad light. Instead of confronting engagements with the community, he issues Vice President TC Wescott to speak on his behalf, he has since fired her. 

## Bharucha has, on two occasions, given exclusive statements to the New York Times with announcements about the future of the college before addressing the Cooper community. 

Bharucha continually manipulates the press, using them to cement decisions in place where consensus has not been reached. On Tuesday, April 22nd the New York Times tweeted: “Cooper Union Will Charge Tuition for Graduate Students.” Bharucha announced a plan to move forward with a “Hybrid Model” where graduate programs and online courses will be expanded and offered for a fee. A school-wide announcement from Bharucha was sent at 12:14pm, the NYT tweet was posted at 12:22pm.Bharucha had announced his plan to the media before even consulting the Cooper community.
