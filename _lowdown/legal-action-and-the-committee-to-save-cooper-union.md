Throughout the duration of the Working Group, alumni and faculty met in parallel to develop a backup plan in case the Board voted in favor of tuition again. The Committee to Save Cooper Union is a not-for-profit organization founded to keep Cooper free through legal efforts and political outreach. The group is led by Engineering alumnus Adrian Jovanovic, along with Art professor Mike Essl and Engineering professor Toby Cumberbatch, and operates in conjunction with FCU, alumni, students, and many supporters.

At the 2014 commencement ceremony, CSCU announced their intention to file a lawsuit against Cooper’s Board in the New York State Supreme Court. The petition calls for five points of action: 

1. An independent accounting of the college’s finances.
2. The creation of an oversight body known as the Associates of Cooper Union.
3. A declaratory judgment that charging tuition goes against the college’s Charter.
4. An injunction to halt the charging of tuition and refund what has been collected so far.
5. The charging of trustees with a “breach of fiduciary duty” for voting to implement tuition. 

Throughout July, CSCU successfully crowdfunded $173,000 from over 1,000 donors to fund the first phase of litigation. During the fundraising period, Cooper’s lawyers attempted to have the case reassigned to the court’s corporate division but were denied. In an attempt to stall litigation, trustees Mark Epstein and Jeremy Wertheimer refused to be served their court papers.

Following these delays, the court date was held on August 15th, 2014. Lawyers for the Committee, the Board, and Wertheimer delivered arguments before Justice Nancy Bannon. While no trustees or administrators were in attendance, supporters of Free Cooper Union and the Committee (including a handful of incoming students) packed the room. At a lunchtime press conference, Jovanovic, State Senator Brad Hoylman, alumnus and former adjunct Ben Degen, and incoming student Claire Kleinman (also a plaintiff in the petition), spoke to a crowd of about a hundred.

The court resumed to hear rebuttals and closing statements. No timeline was set for the judgement (which as of this writing has not been released), but it is expected in the coming weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the case is likely to progress to the appellate court.
