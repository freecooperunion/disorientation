Free Cooper Union, founded in Fall 2012, is a group of students and young alumni working towards free education to all. We affirm:

- Tuition is not a sustainable financial model for Cooper Union, in addition to being a betrayal of the college's radical mission.
- Higher education around the world is in dire need of a paradigm shift. 
- The debate about “tuition” at Cooper must engage broader dialogues about social justice, student debt, educational reform, and alternative models of governance. 

<p class="okhover">To this end, we have employed a wide range of tactics including but not limited to: <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/drafting-petitions.jpg">drafting petitions</span>; <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/walking-out.jpg">walking out</span>; <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/hosting-summits.jpg">hosting summits</span>; producing: <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/memes.jpg">memes</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/satirical-websites.png">satirical websites</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/art-exhibitions.jpg">art exhibitions</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/music-videos.jpg">music videos</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/parades.png">parades</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/historical-reenactments.jpg">historical reenactments</span>, and <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/publications.jpg">publications</span>; <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/poster-bombing.jpg">poster bombing</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/canvassing.jpg">canvassing</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/culture-jamming.jpg">culture-jamming</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/breaking-into-meetings.jpg">breaking into meetings</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/leaking-documents.jpg">leaking documents</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/dropping-banners.jpg">dropping banners</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/talking-to-press.jpg">talking to press</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/building-barricades.jpg">building barricades</span>, <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/occupying.jpg">occupying</span>, and <span class="hoverable" data-okimage="{{site.baseurl}}/img/da-fcu-hover/visioning.jpg">visioning</span>.</p>

In December 2012 we issued the following demands:

## Demands

1. The administration must publicly affirm the college’s commitment to free education. They will stop pursuing new tuition-based educational programs and eliminate other ways in which students are charged for education.
2. The Board of Trustees must immediately implement structural changes with the goal of creating open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. The administration’s gross mismanagement of the school cannot be reversed within the same systems which allowed the crisis to occur. To this end, we have outlined actions that the board must take:
  - Record board meetings and make minutes publicly available.
  - Appoint a student and faculty member from each school as voting members of the board.
  - Implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote from the Cooper Union community, comprised of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.
3. President Bharucha steps down.


Additionally, we drafted a set of principles expanding upon larger systems:

## Principles

### Higher Education Bubble

The over-inflated costs of higher education have placed more than a trillion dollars of debt onto the backs of students. Higher education should be a means of social mobility and intellectual liberation, but it has devolved into an industry that exploits students for profit. Inevitably this bubble will burst and what appears to be a healthy and growing educational system will be revealed as a model that was always doomed to fail.

### Grow Down

The administrators who have grown us into this mess are trying to grow us out of it. Investing in the higher education bubble is short-sighted and uncreative. Playing a larger role in one’s community provides strong roots. If we refuse to invest in a growth model and reaffirm our mission, we stand to see the principles of free education bring life back to our own community and other institutions as well.

### Structures for Transparency and Integrity

Bloated and visionless administrations have become an epidemic threatening institutions of higher education all across America. We must rebuild the governance of these institutions with open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. Carrying a mission such as free education will require principled, rather than self-sustaining, leadership.

## Direct Action

- Students tired of going through Cooper’s circular bureaucracy
- Tried bureaucracy for over a year
- Whole thing was getting desperate
- We were all losing agency
- Revisionist history was happening while we were living it
- To put a halt we began to organize under a campaign of direct actions
- Why? Gets the goodz
- Lock-In
- Occupation
- People will always want to tear down actions and paint protestors as an angry mob but
- Creates a wormhole where anything becomes possible and the community and periphery are wholly engaged
- The space of an action is like an infinite dream. ASSE.
