**On Perceived Neutrality**: Some groups choose to remain neutral, unknown, or undecided on the issue of tuition at Cooper out of fear of retaliation from the administration,  because they feel there is not enough information, or that it’s not their job to make decisions about the way the institution is run. However, conflict occurs within a larger social context from which aspects of identity and oppression cannot be separated. Neutrality privileges those who are less impacted by experiences of systemic violence and lack of access to power or decision-making. It’s our collective responsibility to challenge each other to acknowledge that perceived neutrality reinforces an existing balance of power.
