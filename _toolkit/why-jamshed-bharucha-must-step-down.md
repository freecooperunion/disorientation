These are a collection of incidents that lead us to believe that President Jamshed Bharucha is not fit to believe. He’s conned his way into leading and it’s 2014. He only has the next four semesters, but every moment he stays is costing the school money and time that we don’t have.

## Jamshed has never supported the mission.

He refuses to affirm the value of tuition-free education or its role in Cooper’s history. He has never stated that returning to a tuition-free institution is a goal or priority. On the eve of his inauguration, he ordered the mission statement be changed on cooper.edu, to omit the section about merit-based full-tuition scholarships being granted to all admitted students. Many suspected that he would have to give in, but three years into his presidency he continues to propagate a myth that tuition is the only viable financial model for Cooper Union, even after the Working Group disproved this. 1902 revisionist. Claims to be a scholar while openly demoralizing Peter Buckley (the actual school historian) who refutes his claims. Plays a moral high ground claiming it’s what Peter Cooper would’ve wanted.

## Jamshed has not delivered on repeated promises about transparency.

On September 21st, 2012 the Office of the President introduced “Board Reports” to “provide information about decisions and other outcomes that result from the quarterly Board of Trustees meetings.” While countless meetings have occured, only six board reports have ever been published as of this writing, and they don’t say anything. More recently, Bharucha has cancelled meetings with community members en masse and neglected his responsibility as a communicator within The Cooper Union. During the Occupation and after he basically was never around. After the Occupation he didn’t return to his office for a year, until he could renovate it to include extras locks, security cameras, and keypad entry.

## Jamshed has not acknowledged the Board’s financial negligence.

Despite numerous articles published on Cooper’s financial decisions, there has been no communication from the Board to claim responsibility for their negligence. Bharucha has blamed the alumni, students, faculty and community and approved of passing debt onto future students. He’s played the victim. He’s claimed for the better part of the first half of his presidency that he inherited this mess, he let the larger picture escape and facilitated bad decisions as part of a gamble because he thought he knew better because he was in denial of the Board’s financial negligence. He’s operating on a premise that’s untrue: that they’re not guilty of anything. It’s a logical fallacy. He doesn’t recognize the negliegnce and says he’s the victim. He’s focusing so much on the fact that he wasn’t responsible that we lost two years where he was doing nothing but using stalling tactics to make enough reasonable doubt for there to be so much turnover on the board to make it so that now there actually aren;t enough people that witnessed. They flipped at one point to say: there is some negligence but the problems have been going on for 40 years. He hams it up to make it more prominent than it has been. Cooper has survived ebbs and flows through great depression. He might be right about last 30 years being turbulent but using the fact that the people before him were wrong to say he can’t be wrong.

## Jamshed has ignored multiple votes of no confidence from faculties, students, alumni, and the broader community

Link these:
FOCU http://friendsofcooperunion.org/vote-no-confidence
Faculties
Art. 
Humanities? (Gail Buckland email) Unions? (statements)
With more than 2,500 votes of “no confidence” in Bharucha, including votes passed by the School of Art, and School of Art Full-Time faculty, as well as a majority of the Faculty of the Humanities vote of no confidence in “the leadership” of the institution, what is lacking is an earnest engagement with the community in generating solutions which uphold the mission of free education to all.

## Bharucha has marginalized and disregarded alternative models by trustees, students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Time and time again, the community has set forth viable alternatives to tuition and implored the Board to discuss them. Instead of working through these proposals in good faith, Bharucha and the Board have pursued a consistent strategy of disengaging from such discussions, and speciously discrediting proposals once they can no longer be ignored.

### 2011: Bharucha created Taskforces to fake community buy-in of tuition

At the same time that Bharucha announced Cooper’s “fiscal crisis,” he launched two “Reinvention Task Forces” devoted to Expense Reduction and Revenue Generation. These were framed as community efforts, but it quickly became apparent that their results had been pre-determined by Bharucha. An online forum was launched to collect community input, but all posts were moderated by a Cooper administrator, and the entire site has since been deleted. Taskforce members initially sought to look around tuition, but Bharucha manipulated the process and appointed members in such a way that tuition became a major part of the Taskforce’s reccomendations. Several Taskforce members, including faculty member Christine Osinski, later publicly spoke out against the document and the process. The most egregious fact about the taskforce is how Bharucha wasted an entire year to fake the appearance of community buy-in, wasting time and money that the community did not have to lose.

### April 2012: Bharucha dissed and discredited the first comprehensive community-authored alternative model

The Way Forward was a document by Friends of Cooper Union putting forward a holistic alternative to the Board’s agenda, including reccomendations on finances, community, and academics. Leaked board minutes showed trustees openly discussing ways to avoid meeting with members of FOCU, as well as sharing strategies to diffuse their questions. When FOCU’s financial modeling was obstructed by a lack of access to Cooper’s detailed financial information, the group went through the trouble of engaging an independent financial analyst. Still, Bharucha deemed this document a “laughing stock.”

### February 2013: Bharucha implemented “Responsibility Centered Management,” to make it look like the faculty came up with charging tuition

In 2012, the deans of the three degree-granting schools were charged by Bharucha to come up with plans to generate a certain amount of money by way of revenue-generating academic programs. The deans, in turn, charged the faculties with drafting these proposals. This is what’s known as “Responsibility Centered Management,” a model theorized by the administration’s consultants The Huron Group. 

RCM has since been disproven as an ethical style of leadership, because of the way it can be misused to claim that all parties participated in the creation of a pre-determined plan. By delegating increasingly specific tasks down a chain of command, RCM creates an appearance of stakeholder agency and collaboration at all levels of a bureaucracy, when in fact it simply fullfills directives set by top-level admistrators. Crucially, RCM leaves no room for dissent or challening the bounds of a problem. For example: it was implied in the RCM charge that Cooper needed paying programs, and there was no process to dispute this claim. 

The three faculties were essentially forced to deliver plans for tuition-based educational programs — work for which they were not even paid, and which Unions claimed may have violated agreements about faculty doing administrative work. 

The Art faculty in particular understood the quandries of RCM and came up with two methods to oppose the process. One strategy was to not attend the RCM meetings, but many faculty believed that if the administration was intent on revenue-generating educational programs, that their participation could at least mitigate damage to the academics. The second strategy was a refusal to endorse the plans they had delivered, instead issuing a unanimous statement in support of the college’s existing mission, and a statement that the RCM charge was, “subtly coercive.”

### May 2013: Within Our Mission, Within Our Means (Bharucha destroys faculty attempts to propose

Having had their energies appropriated by the mandatory Reinvention process, which pre-determined an ongoing expansion in programs and revenue, the faculties recognized a need to reframe the question. In order to overcome the administration’s strategic and divisive seperation of the faculty, the ‘Faculty of the Whole’ (all four faculties, including humanities) began meeting, independent of the administration, to collaboratively a proposal. Their discussions centered around the phrase, “Within our mission, within our means.” Their intention was to imagine — starting with Cooper’s existing revenue streams of tens of millions of dollars — how the faculties could reshape the college from the ground up to live within its means.

Faculty members described these collaborative visioning sessions as productive and unprecedented. Unfortunately, before they could progress, their work was cut short.

### May 2013: Bharucha coerced the Art faculty into endorsing tuition

The “Missions, Means, Union” discussions, in conjunction with the Art faculty’s vote against the Reinvention process, proved so threatening to the Board that they began making preparations to shut down the School of Art entirely. Out of concern that this discussion was advancing too far behind closed doors, former Trustee and School of Art alumna Audrey Flack approached the Art faculty with this information. Rumors solidified into an ultimatum: unless faculty capitulated to Reinvention, the Board would begin closing the School of Art immediately.

The Art faculty stood their ground. In response, Bharucha and the Board’s Executive Committee moved to defer all early decision School of Art applicants midway through the admissions cycle, without consulting or even informing the faculty. The faculty had already chosen the students, and their acceptance letters were sitting on a desk ready to be mailed, when Bharucha ordered Dean of Admissions Mitchell Lipton to put a hold on the mailing.

Concerned that the Art faculty’s vote made him appear unsupported and tyrannical, Bharucha, despite having received the Art faculty’s Reinvention plans, was refusing to submit them to the Board until the faculty publicly endorsed them. Bharucha’s withholding of this information created an impression amongst the Board, whose sole point of contact with faculty at this point was Bharucha himself, that the Art faculty had refused to participate in finding financially viable solutions. The fact of the matter was that the Art faculty had participated in Reinvention against their will, while also spearheading an independent alternative process. Bharucha’s miscommunication exacerbated tensions between the Art faculty and Board. 

The Art faculty panicked. Fearing for the future of their school, they moved to vote to rescind the statement against Reinvention and endorse the plans they had drafted, so that Bharucha could submit them to the Board. The meeting was so fraught that it lasted two days. Within minutes of being informed by Dean Bos that the vote had passed, Bharucha had sent a pre-written campus-wide email stating that he was pleased that the Art faculty had “come around.”

Bharucha has often said that he won’t to do anything, “without the support of his faculty” — but the truth behind such statements is that he will obtain support by any means necessary. Further, Bharucha’s strategic withholding of information proves not to be an isolated incident, but a pattern of bottlenecking communications and abusing his role as a point of contact with the Board, to avoid the appearance of tyranny.

### Working Group

(For brevity, this section only covers Bharucha’s interventions into the Working Group, but a more detailed overview is available in the lowdown section.)

In a group that could only be formed by going over his head, Bharucha still employed all of his influence remaining after the Occupation to disrupt the Working Group’s operation. 

Amidst elections to appoint Working Group representatives, Bharucha abruptly fired T.C. Westcott, Vice President of Finance and Administration, which handicapped the process in several ways:

- Westcott, would’ve been a logical appointee to the group or at least a useful administrative liaison. She was instead bound by a non-disclosure agreement, effectively sealing her institutional knowledge and expertise from the group.
- The day after her firing, Wescott had been slated to meet with a faculty union representative to resolve negotations delaying faculty participation in the Working Group. After the firing, this process was effectively stalled for a month. This diminished ⅓ of the Working Group’s allotted work time, while allowing Bharucha to claim that the unions (a favorite scapegoat) were causing the problem. 
- Westcott’s firing also necessitated the hiring of interim financial consultants, The Huron Group (responsible for the earlier mis-implementation of Responsibility Centered Management). While the Working Group was supposed to provide open books to its members, every request was now screened by a consultancy at Bharucha’s discretion. Consequently, many requests for financial information were evaded, stalled, and obfuscated in delivery.

The three administrators that ended up being appointed by Bharucha (rather than elected, as with all other participating constituencies except the trustees) included a two secretaries and a dean newly hired by Bharucha. All of these members were found by the community to expressly disagree with the very charge of the Working Group from the outset, but attempts to reconfigure the appointments by trustee Mike Borkowsky were stonewalled.

## Bharucha maintains an oppressive and policing environment.

Increased private security measures to keep alumni out and to monitor students, faculty and their gatherings. 

Multiple instances of armed guards in the building without informing deans, students, parents, and faculty.

Confiscation and/or dismantling of approved artwork from classrooms, hallways and exhibition spaces.

Adjunct faculty (who make up the majority of faculty) having had their jobs threatened if they sign the vote of no confidence.

Student arrested while trying to leave Foundation Building during a protest she was not involved in (Sarah Abruna, 2011).

Bharucha has failed to articulate a vision for the future of Cooper.

On May 11, 2013 Bharucha reiterated his five-point vision of the school: 

> “a student body that thrives on an intimate, immersive, rigorous conservatory-style education; a unique set of schools; a commitment to access for those who can least afford it; the historic Great Hall; and the most vibrant location on earth.”

 This is merely a description, not a vision. 

## Bharucha can’t explain free education to donors.

Bharucha doesn’t know what goes on in our classes or how our education happens. Why is he the one talking to Bloomberg and other potential large donors? How can we expect him to sell the school to donors if he can’t even talk about the school passionately. 

President Bharucha doesn’t believe that Cooper’s full-tuition scholarship is necessary, he believes it to be resource that’s run dry. How can Bharucha sell the egalitarian vision of ‘free education for all’ to donors if he doesn’t even believe in it. Trustee Mike Borkowsky has very elegantly described his feelings about Cooper:

> “I got a degree in mechanical engineering from Cooper and never spent a moment of my working life as a mechanical engineer or as any other kind of engineer. Given that fact, many people wonder why I have spent so much of my life involved with the school. It is because Cooper Union embodies, in my mind, the ideal of higher education. You put 1,000 of the brightest, most creative young people together, with no regard for their economic status or personal backgrounds, challenge them to work as hard as they can, to collaborate rather than compete with each other, give them the opportunity to interact fully with faculty, set them all in the dynamic environment of New York City and do it with no charge for tuition and you have an institution of learning that is unique in all the world and must be saved.”

## Bharucha has diffused accountability and blame

Bharucha’s administration is heavily stacked and growing. He is the singular bottleneck between the Cooper community and the Board, he has withheld information from both parties and continually misrepresents the Cooper community by casting it in a bad light. Instead of confronting engagements with the community, he issues Vice President TC Wescott to speak on his behalf, he has since fired her. 

## Bharucha has, on two occasions, given exclusive statements to the New York Times with announcements about the future of the college before addressing the Cooper community. 

Bharucha continually manipulates the press, using them to cement decisions in place where consensus has not been reached. On Tuesday, April 22nd the New York Times tweeted: “Cooper Union Will Charge Tuition for Graduate Students.” Bharucha announced a plan to move forward with a “Hybrid Model” where graduate programs and online courses will be expanded and offered for a fee. A school-wide announcement from Bharucha was sent at 12:14pm, the NYT tweet was posted at 12:22pm.Bharucha had announced his plan to the media before even consulting the Cooper community.
