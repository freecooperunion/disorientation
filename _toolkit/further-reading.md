College in Ohio founded by Horace Mann with a radical history and interesting historical ties to Cooper. Board attempted to commercially franchise the school’s brand, resulting in bankruptcy.

Unofficial motto: “Freedom, not Licence.”

## Tools for Organizing

### [GroupMe](http://groupme.com)

Private chatrooms that work across smartphones, dumbphones (e.g. text messages), and web browsers. Useful for ongoing banter and during actions.

### [Celly](http://cel.ly)

Mass text message announcements. This is a two-way service but not as good for chatting as GroupMe.

### [Google Docs](http://drive.google.com)

Share documents, spreadsheets, and files. Useful for collaborative writing and resource-sharing.

### [Trello](http://trello.com)

Collaborative to-do list that has been used during actions to coordinate tasks across a large group.

### [Github](http://github.com)

Social network for code, this is where we’re hosting the Disorientation website and other code-related projects.

### [Hackpad](http://hackpad.com)

Collaborative text-editor with wiki features like document linking, is public by default, and keeps track of authorship better than Google Docs.

### [Facebook](http://facebook.com)

Social network. Lots of community banter happens on groups like Save Cooper Union, private groups are sometimes used for organizing, messages can be a useful way to reach people who don’t check their email, events can draw people in to actions or workshops, and several pages (like Free Cooper Union) keep people informed or share funny stuff. Pro tip: if you’re setting up an event, get various people to download an “Invite All” browser extension and use it to invite their networks.

### [Twitter](http://twitter.com)

The other major social network for distributing information, keeping track of banter, and participating in discussion. There is an official @FreeCooperUnion account, and other groups have accounts too. The search function is useful.

### [Google News](http://google.com/news)

Search engine for news. After a press event or announcement you can refresh the search for “Cooper Union” to keep track of articles as they come in. You can also set up alerts that will email you a summary as articles appear.

### [Livestream](http://livestream.com)

### [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com)

Self-hosted alternative for email newsletters, less regulation of lists than Mailchimp, and can be cheaper at scale.

[Nationbuilder](http://nationbuilder.com)

Political organizing platform that can be used to centralize social media, mailing, and fundraising activities.
