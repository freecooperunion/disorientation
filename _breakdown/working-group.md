After a two month long occupation of President Jamshed Bharuchaâ€™s office, terms upon which the occupying students would exit the office were coordinated by Free Cooper Union and Trustees Mike Borkowsky and Jeffery Gural. These terms most notably included the creation of a Working Group made up of students, alumni, faculty, staff, and administrators with the sole purpose of finding means to reverse the tuition decision made on April 23, 2013. After initial trouble due to administrative delays, the Working Group met during the Fall semester of 2013, with the clear intent of keeping The Cooper Union free to all.
