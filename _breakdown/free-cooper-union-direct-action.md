Free Cooper Union, founded in Fall 2012, is a group of students and young alumni working towards free education to all. We affirm:

Tuition is not a sustainable financial model for Cooper Union, in addition to being a betrayal of the college's radical mission.
Higher education around the world is in dire need of a paradigm shift. 
The debate about “tuition” at Cooper must engage broader dialogues about social justice, educational reform, debt forgiveness, and alternative organizational models. 

To this end, we have employed a wide range of tactics including but not limited to: drafting petitions; walking out; hosting summits; producing: memes, satirical websites, art exhibitions, music videos, parades, historical reenactments, and publications; poster bombing, canvassing, culture-jamming, breaking into meetings, leaking documents, dropping banners, talking to press, building barricades, occupying, and visioning.



A proposal for an “exhibition” on the 6th floor to be followed by a performance elsewhere, 2013.

Since Fall 2012, we have advocated for the following demands and principles.
Demands
The administration must publicly affirm the college’s commitment to free education. They will stop pursuing new tuition-based educational programs and eliminate other ways in which students are charged for education.
The Board of Trustees must immediately implement structural changes with the goal of creating open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. The administration’s gross mismanagement of the school cannot be reversed within the same systems which allowed the crisis to occur. To this end, we have outlined actions that the board must take:
Record board meetings and make minutes publicly available.
Appoint a student and faculty member from each school as voting members of the board.
Implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote from the Cooper Union community, comprised of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.
President Bharucha steps down.
Principles
Higher Education Bubble
The over-inflated costs of higher education have placed more than a trillion dollars of debt onto the backs of students. Higher education should be a means of social mobility and intellectual liberation, but it has devolved into an industry that exploits students for profit. Inevitably this bubble will burst and what appears to be a healthy and growing educational system will be revealed as a model that was always doomed to fail.
Grow Down
The administrators who have grown us into this mess are trying to grow us out of it. Investing in the higher education bubble is short-sighted and uncreative. Playing a larger role in one’s community provides strong roots. If we refuse to invest in a growth model and reaffirm our mission, we stand to see the principles of free education bring life back to our own community and other institutions as well.
Structures for Transparency and Integrity
Bloated and visionless administrations have become an epidemic threatening institutions of higher education all across America. We must rebuild the governance of these institutions with open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures. Carrying a mission such as free education will require principled, rather than self-sustaining, leadership.
