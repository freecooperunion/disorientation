The Committee to Save Cooper Union, Inc. is a not-for-profit organization founded in Winter 2013 by alumnus Adrian Jovanovic and faculty members Mike Essl (Art) and Toby Cumberbatch (Engineering), focusing on legal and political efforts. CSCU operates in conjunction with FCU, alumni, students, and many supporters. Their ongoing Supreme Court lawsuit against Cooper’s Board of Trustees represents the public unveiling of efforts developed over years of quiet, anonymous organizing against tuition from within Cooper’s faculties. In July 2014, CSCU successfully crowdfunded $173,000 from over 1,000 donors to fund the first phase of litigation.
