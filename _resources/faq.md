Cooper Union was established as a free school in almost all of its educational activities.  The night schools of art and science were always free, and explicitly made so in the founding documents.  The Day School of Art for Women, originally called the Female School of Design, has a more complex history that is worth examining in close detail given the way that the very small numbers of fee paying students admitted to the school have been shoved into a Trojan horse and wheeled into Peter Cooper’s founding intent.

Whereas those students in the Night School, presumed to be already at work, could use Cooper Union to improve their careers and fortunes, some women in the Day School could use their art courses to preserve their class location. Both the industrial (free) and amateur (paying) students in the Female School of Design needed each other according to the women’s advisory council, which served as a supplementary level of trusteeship: the wealthier among the students could provide models of social refinement and funds, whereas the more unfortunate could provide examples of seriousness of purpose...

By the tenth annual report, the emphasis on training for “self-support” had been firmly re-established and the vestiges of the amateur class were removed:

> “On the whole, the attempt to instruct women in Art, with a view to securing a livelihood, may be pronounced a success, but the conditions of success are in this the same as in all other pursuits, unwearied devotion to the work to be done. The only failures which occur, aside from the want of natural capacity, are due solely to the lack of industry and perseverance on the part of the pupil. Such failures occur quite as often with men as with women, and hence the Trustees see no cause for discouragement in the attempt to educate the latter for a career of honest industry in the arts of design. The cost of conducting the school during the last year, for instruction, has been $5,118.19. The instruction is absolutely gratuitous, and no paying pupils have been or will hereafter be received. (Annual Report v10, 1869.)”

From 1870, “free” was added to the official title of the day school.

By 1869 then, all courses that led to certificates, diplomas or, eventually, degrees were free.  The 1902/3 date floated by the Office of the President is designed, for legal and ideological purposes, to separate free tuition from the era and intent of the founder. The date refers to the new day school of technology that only started in 1902.  The school could not have been free before 1902 because it didn’t exist! The President is overly keen to establish a new history of free tuition at Cooper Union to make sure that the mission of the whole college is only a matter of Carnegie’s cash rather than 
Cooper’s conviction.
